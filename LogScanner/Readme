LogScanner is a multi-threaded java program that scans one or multiple log files according to custom filters, 
generates a report ("output/LogScanner_Report.html"), and sends an email with the report attached.

The "LogScanner.zip" file is a compressed eclipse project.  To run LogScanner, first edit the 
"LogScanner.properties" file, then run the com.logscanner.LogScanner.java class.
